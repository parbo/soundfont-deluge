# soundfont-deluge
A tool for converting [SoundFont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundFont) files to [Synthstrom Deluge](https://synthstrom.com/product/deluge/) XML instruments

SoundFont sounds can be more complex than Dleuge sounds, but this tool tries to map things as well as it can, e.g. by averaging envelope values etc.
